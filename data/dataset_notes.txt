Dataset Files Information
=========================

Files Used in This Project:
---------------------------
✓ HAM10000_images_part_1/       - Full-resolution dermoscopic images (part 1)
✓ HAM10000_images_part_2/       - Full-resolution dermoscopic images (part 2)
✓ HAM10000_metadata.csv         - Labels and patient metadata

Files NOT Used (Downloaded but Ignored):
----------------------------------------
✗ hmnist_8_8_L.csv              - 8×8 grayscale downsampled version
✗ hmnist_8_8_RGB.csv            - 8×8 RGB downsampled version
✗ hmnist_28_28_L.csv            - 28×28 grayscale downsampled version
✗ hmnist_28_28_RGB.csv          - 28×28 RGB downsampled version

Why We Don't Use the CSV Files:
--------------------------------
The hmnist CSV files contain extremely low-resolution versions of the images
(8×8 and 28×28 pixels) designed for quick MNIST-style experiments.

These are too small for meaningful skin lesion analysis, which requires
observing fine details like:
- Color patterns and variations
- Border irregularities
- Surface texture
- Vascular structures

For medical image analysis, we use the full-resolution JPG images 
(typically 600×450 to 1024×768 pixels) which are then resized to 224×224
for ResNet50 input while preserving important diagnostic features.

You can safely delete the hmnist CSV files to save disk space (saves ~130 MB).
